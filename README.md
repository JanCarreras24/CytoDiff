# CytoDiff â€“ AI-Driven Cytomorphology Image Synthesis for Medical Diagnostics

This repository contains the full codebase developed at Helmholtz Munich. The project aims to improve blood cell image classification by augmenting real data with high-quality synthetic images generated using diffusion models and LoRA-based fine-tuning.

---

## Pipeline Overview

The repository follows a three-stage pipeline:

1. **LoRA Training**  
2. **Image Generation**  
3. **Image Classification**

Each step depends on the successful completion of the previous one and must be executed in order.

---

## Setup

Install all required packages listed in the `requirements/` directory. Using a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) is recommended.

```bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
